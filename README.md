# Experiment Data Prepare

## Introduce
This project process source code into ECFG, and formatting data to standard dataset, which could feed into [MFGNN](https://) directly..

There are three part in this project
* `codes datas` directory: `codes` directory for source code, and `datas` directory for extend-CFG. Three experiments' dataset are compressed and you should `unzip` first.

* `clang_cfg.so` static library: The library build from [clang-cfg](https://github.com/zzhzz/clang-cfg). If you want to run script on your platform, please build static library first.

* `include` directory: for processing header files of C/C++

* `main.py, merge.py, config.py, utils.py`: Those files are data process script, you can config your process in `config.py`

* Unlike C/C++ part, `codes/promise.zip` contains graphs generated by [ECFG4J](https://github.com/zzhzz/ECFG4J), which is processed directly.
